## Step 3: Review

<span id='review'></span>

reviewer check the translation and decide whether to approve or not.



## Step 4: Release

<span id='release'></span>

master release first version.



## Step 5: Iteration

<span id='iteration'></span>

### Scenarios that trigger iteration
- **negative feedback**: guest submit suggestions to optimization.
- **new items**:  master add more items to the project.

## version iteration procedures

The first two step are slightly different for those scenarios, and others are same.

1. guest submit suggestions **(only for negative feedback)**

2. master decide to accept negative feedback, and re-assigned this item to translator **(negative feedback)**; master assign new items to translators **(new items)**.

3. translator contiously translate until approved.

4. review review the translation.

5. master release new version.
