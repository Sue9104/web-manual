* CPU: Intel Core or Xeon 3GHz \(or Dual Core 2GHz\) or equal AMD CPU

* cores: Single \(Dual/Quad Core is recommended\)

* RAM: 4 GB \(6 GB recommended\)

## Operating System

> #### Note:: Recommend
>
> We highly recommend to install Trantrace with docker-compose.

- [install with docker-compose](install-with-docker-compose.md): Even though lots of operating systems are supported by docker-compose and docker, **Linux or Mac** is recommended.

- [install from source code](install-from-source.md): **Ubuntu 16.04** is recommended.


## Browser

We have only tested Trantrace on four browsers with the latest stable version, so others may have incompatibility issues.


Supported browser:
- Google Chrome (>=70)
- Firefox (>=67)
- Safari (>=12)
- Edge (>=44)
- IE11.
