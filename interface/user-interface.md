# User Interface

<span id='user'></span>

All users share same interface, but have different workspace depending on the role in project.
 
## Personal Statistics

<span id='stat'></span>

All the workload and complete percentage will be listed by project:
- **allocation**: if you are master of one project, the total item numbers, allocated and unallocated percentage will show here.
- **conflict handling**: if you are master of one project, suggestion numbers, processed and unprocessed will show here.
- **translation**: if you are translator of one project, the item numbers that assigned to you, translated and unretranslated percentage will show here.
- **review**: if you are reviewer of one project, the item numbers that have been translated, reviewed and unreviewed percentage will show here. **Since the reviewers have not been allocated by master, all reviewers share same progress**.
