# User Interface

All users except administrator share same interface but have different permissions on different panels according to project roles. 

- Summary of unfinished tasks for every user
  - [Dashboard](#stat)
  - [My Task](#mytask)   
- Workspace for different project roles
  - [Owner: Project Management](owner-project-management.md)
  - [Translator: Translation Management](translator-translation-management.md)
  - [Reviewer: Review Management](reviewer-review-management.md)
  - [All Members: Released Projects](guest-released-projects.md)

Though all project members can search released translation and open issues in "Released Projects", only owner has the right to resolve issues.

### My Task

<span id='mytask'></span>

My task summaries unfinished tasks and updates every minute. 
These unfinished tasks are divided into five categories no matter which project is: 

- **'Unassigned'** and **'Unresolved'** for owner
- **'Untranslated'** and **'Unretranslated'** for translator
- **'Unreviewed'** for reviewer. 

Click and it will jump to these unfinished tasks. For more detail, see [entry status and issue status](../glossary.md).
