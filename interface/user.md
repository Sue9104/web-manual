# User Interface

All users except the administrator share the same interface but have different permissions on different panels according to project roles. 

- Summary of unfinished tasks for everyone
  - [Dashboard](#stat)
  - [My Task](#mytask)   
- Workspace for different project roles
  - [Owner: Project Management](owner-project-management.md)
  - [Translator: Translation Management](translator-translation-management.md)
  - [Reviewer: Review Management](reviewer-review-management.md)
  - [All Members: Released Projects](all-released-projects.md)

Though all project members can search released translation and open issues in "Released Projects", only the owner has the right to resolve issues.

## Summary of unfinished tasks

### Dashboard

<span id='stat'></span>

Dashboard counts the user's workload, complete percentage and unfinished numbers according to task categories (Assignment, Translation, Review and Issues) and project name. 
- Click on the blue text in the last column and it will jump to unfinished tasks.
- If the project is highlighted in pink, it means that the tasks have not finished before deadline.

### My Task

<span id='mytask'></span>

My task summaries unfinished tasks and updates every minute. 
These unfinished tasks are divided into five categories no matter which project it is: 

- **'Unassigned'** and **'Unresolved'** are tasks for owner in "Assignment" and "Issues" respectively.
- **'Untranslated'** and **'Unretranslated'** are tasks for translator  in "Translation" and "Retranslation" respectively.
- **'Unreviewed'** are tasks for reviewer in "Review". 

Click and it will jump to these unfinished tasks. For more detail, see [entry status and issue status](../glossary.md).
